Elevator Pitch<br>
Elementally is a puzzle game inspired by M.C. Escher and the three elements of nature. Manipulate the illusional maze to reach the destination while collecting artifacts from each level. The collected artifacts can trigger different mechanisms like rotation gears and sliding objects at each level which will help arrange isometric blocks. The correct arrangement of blocks will pave a way to the destination and help in collecting one of the three elements. Players must solve all the puzzles in order to collect all the elements of the earth. <br><br>
Goal<br>
Logically arrange isometric blocks in each level by solving the illusion to reach the destination and collect an element.
